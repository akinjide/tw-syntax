### BBEdit/TextWrangler Language Module

You can use them however you'd like.

If you have any other syntax file you want include, fork and make a pull request or let's chat on Twitter  [@_akinjide](https://twitter.com/_akinjide).

#### Installation

- clone this repository
- copy the `*.plist` files to `~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules` or equivalent. You may have to create the `Language Modules or TextWrangler folder` if it doesn't exist.
- Quit and Relaunch TextWrangler :)
